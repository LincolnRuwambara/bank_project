## Goal <a name="Goal"></a>
The goal of this project is to create the backend setup of a financial institution (Bank) application where the user of the application can log in as either a admin and as a customer.
 As an admin, you can add new customers and get a full view of the database. As a customer you can only view information about your current account, the loans that have been taken, 
 available and useful information like the interest rates and currencies

- ## Database Structure <a name='Database Structure'></a>
The project is going to be developing its database using PostgreSQL and the following schema is to be implemented:

- ### Customer:
This table stores information about the bank's customer. Contains essential information about the customer used to link the customer to their bank accounts and other services like loans. 
- ### Account:
Used to store customer's account details. Show the date the account was created or the account was delete and relevant information linking to the customer like customer id




- ### Loan:
The table serves the purpose of saving information about loans granted to the bankï¿½s customers like amount, date issued, customer ID and branch where the loan was issued.<p>
Currency:
This table saves information about the currencies that the bank offers and other information that are usual in service delivery in the banking sector like exchange rate<p>.
